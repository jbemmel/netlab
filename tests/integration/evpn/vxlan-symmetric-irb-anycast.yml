  The devices under test are layer-3 switches running VXLAN/EVPN with
  symmetric IRB. Hosts are in three VLANs, all in one VRF - each with anycast gateway

  All hosts should be able to ping each other.

addressing:
  anycast-pool:
    ipv4: 10.1.0.0/20
    prefix: 24
    anycast_gateway: 1  # .1 of every ipv4/ipv6 subnet

  anycast-pool2:
    ipv4: 10.2.0.0/20
    prefix: 24
    anycast_gateway: True  # Default: last of every ipv4/ipv6 subnet

groups:
  hosts:
    members: [ h1, h2, h3, h4 ]
    device: linux
  switches:
    members: [ s1,s2 ]
    module: [ vlan,vxlan,ospf,bgp,evpn,vrf ]
