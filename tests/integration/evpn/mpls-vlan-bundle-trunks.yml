  The devices under test are EVPN/MPLS PE-devices using multiple VLAN bundles per (trunk) port

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other on red and green vlans
  * h1 should be able to reach h3 on blue, and h4 on green
  * h3 and h4 should not be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
